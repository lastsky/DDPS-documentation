Translate and insert vision statement from _DDoS Detection and Mitigation Service_MB.docx_ here.

The vision statement sets the direction for the project by specifying what will
be accomplished. It defines the scope of the project. The main elements of a
vision statement include:

  -	Project goals – Projects start with an idea to solve a problem or take
    advantage of an opportunity. The goals of the project should align with the
    problems and opportunities identified. Goals express the expected outcomes from
    a project. Goals should be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented,
    Realistic, and Timely.

  -	Project scope – What is and is not included in the project?

  -	High-level features or requirements. Are some features more important than
   	others? One way of prioritizing features is to divide them into two
   	classes: essential and desirable.

  -	Major milestones and deliverables.

Two useful exercises for developing a vision statement are [Agile Project Management]:

  -	Pretend the software will be sold as a retail commercial product and then
   	design the box in which the software will ship. The shrink-wrapped box for
   	retail software lists the key features of the software from the user’s
   	perspective.

  -	Develop an elevator statement for the project. A good elevator statement
   	answers the question “what” and “why” in a succinct and compelling way.

Here is a convenient template for developing an elevator statement for a product:

  -	For (target customer)
  -	Who (statement of need or opportunity)
  -	The (product name) is a (product category)
  -	That (key benefit, compelling reason to buy)
  -	Unlike (primary competitive alternative)
  -	Our product (statement of primary differentiation)

### Example
For computer users of all ages who want to socialize and keep in touch with
family, friends and associates, the _MultiFace_ web site is a social networking
web site that allows users to maintain multiple personas. Unlike traditional
social networking web sites such as Faceook and MySpace, our product allows
users to maintain separate and distinct identifies for different groups of
family, friends and associates.

A good vision statement helps you make decisions regarding priorities and what
to include and exclude.
